      <h2>Steeped in Tradition</h2>
      <p>Your first lunch at a company should be memorable. It's not good enough to visit the local eatery- for many years,
        LinkedIn would take new hires to Arby's, home of the Roast Beef Sandwich. Just one look at the dizzying array of
        sandwiches above should tell you why this is a favorite of Web Development shops who's name end in "kedIn". Like
        Web Development here at LinkedIn, Arby's too is full of tradition</p>
      <p>It started in 1965 in Arkon, Ohio with a logo that resembled a 10-gallon hat. By 1975 the hat we known and love
        was the logo of choice; by 1980 over 1,000 restaurants existed around the country. The silicon valley was blessed with
        not one but <strong>two</strong> Arby's franchises in the first 15 years. The 256th Arby's (that's 2^8 for all you
        who believe this was meant to be) was opened on South Bernardo in Sunnyvale, CA. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

      <h2>Our Arby's</h2>
      <p>Arby's Franchise 256 is located at <a href="#">601 S Bernardo Ave in Sunnyvale, CA</a>. When you're in a rush from
        LinkedIn, the fastest way there is highway 85 South, exiting at El Camino Real (highway 82) South. Though it might seem like
        a long drive on El Camino Real, hang in there and follow your nose. The Arby's is on the right hand side, at the corner
        of El Camino Real and S Bernardo Ave.
      </p>
      <p>Returning from Arby's is difficult; not because of the directions, but because of how full of happiness and joy you
        will be. Either make a U-turn on El Camino Real or a left turn from S Bernardo Ave to begin traveling North on El
        Camino Real. Take the 85 North onramp on the righthand side, and exit Shoreline. From here, returning to work should
        be easy.</p>
      <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Beyond the Arby's, there's this other restaurant called Adamsons. While they have excellent
        French Dip sandwiches, <em>don't be fooled</em>! It smells like Arby's, it might even look a bit like Arby's, but
        it most assuredly is not. When you want Arby's, be sure to stop at the Arby's and don't go further.</p>
